# Comprint
Comprint is an image forgery detection and localization method that utilizes compression fingerprints.

## Installation
The code requires Python 3.X and was built with Tensorflow 2.9.1.

Install the requested libraries using:
```
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training
First, download the training and validation data, and place it in data/train and data/validation, respectively.
Downloadlinks can be found in data/downloadlinks_train_and_validation.txt.

Training settings can be changed with the corresponding variables in code/train_network.py and train_network_siamese.py.

Then the shell scripts in the main folder start the training. For training the pre-trained network that estimates JPEG artifacts:

```
bash run-training.sh
```

For training the siamese network that extracts the comprint:
```
bash run-training-siamese.sh
```

### Comprint and heatmap extraction
The Jupyter notebook code/get_comprint_heatmap.ipynb gives an example on how to extract the comprint and heatmap. By changing the filename / path, you can extract the comprint from other images under investigation. Our trained models are included in the models folder.
